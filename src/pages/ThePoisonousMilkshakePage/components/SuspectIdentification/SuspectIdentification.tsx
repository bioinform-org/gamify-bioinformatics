        The police interviewed Mirko and the people he met with in the past two
        days. They sent us a timeline of his whereabouts.
        <br />
        <br />
        Letâ€™s figure out who might have been involved!
        <br />
        <br />
         Read the <a href="#">timeline</a> and deduce whether each person
        had a motive and a mean to poison Mirko. Use the findings from the
        previous sections to deduce whether each person had an opportunity to
        commit the crime. Note that all samples except for 5 and 10 were of dark
        hair and that all samples except for 3, 4 and 8 were of short hair.
